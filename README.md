# Run-Game-Engine

How to build on all platforms:

its pretty simple just run the buld.gradle file and run the main file. 

if you look in the gradle file you might be wondering why I import imgui-java 3 time for each platform and thats becuase it imports the macos bindings for me instead of the windows bindings for some reason.

I can't figure out why and lwjgl dosn't import the macos bindings.

there is no documentation yet but once the engine is at a more complete state I will spend some time writing the docs.
